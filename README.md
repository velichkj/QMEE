Update: In the future, I will want to plot Hg concentration against total length for each species at each site. I will want to see whether the regression for this line varies across sites for each species - for this I would have to do an anlysis of covariance I believe (i.e. see if the slopes differ, and if the intercepts differ). Furthermore, I will want to see if there is a significant difference in Hg concentration between the sites for each species - for this I could use an ANOVA test. 

To break my project into replicable components I will clean my data (if necessary) and save my results in a new CSV file. 

JD: You can also consider just saving in an Rdata file.

My data consists of fish I have collected from the Saint John River this past summer (2020). I collected Smallmouth Bass (SMB) and Yellow Perch (YP), both adult and young of year (YOY), at three sites along the river in reference to a hydroelectric dam: Reference (REF) which is upstream of the dam, Near Field (NF) which is downstream of the dam, and Far Field (FF) which is farther downstream from the dam. I have approximately 25 adult fish per species per site (except no SMB were found in FF) and 15 YOY per species per site (except no YP YOY were found in NF and no YOY SMB were found in FF). When the fish were collected, we recorded their length and weight. We also dissected the fish for their muscle tissue which will be used to determine total mercury (Hg) concentration and fatty acid (FA) profiles. As of now, I have completed the mercury analysis for approximately half of the adult fish. Mercury is measured in ug per wet weight (ug/kgww) and and ug per dry weight (ug/kgdw). With my data, I hope to: 1) characterize the profiles of Hg and FAs in fish from the Saint John River and compare them to Canadian guidelines on fish consumption and 2) examine how Hg and FAs in fish vary geographically in relation to the dam.
